The storyline and casting though. Can we please stop casting Matt Damon for fighting roles? Dude always need to get rescued at the end. Zhang might be using Matt to get the movie to catch out West, but the most tasteful job this was not. Matt can\'t even shoot a bow right. (It\'s right there on the poster.) How is he going to be a general? As an Asian American, the uniforms of the generals come off wrong too. Way to push on stereotypes that he never got to deal with. I understand why he wanted to cast Matt, but the story is not something that would interest "Westerners" and would straight offend Asian Americans. It\'s an Asian movie. If anything, cast someone hot FROM ASIA. Takeshi Kaneshiro, Lau, whoever.',

The extravagant display of wealth with the helicopter and the bazooka party. No, you cannot be driving like that in Singapore, let alone have a bazooka. Perhaps it\'s because of my background. I\'m not mad that they had a Korean play a Chinese, but that family is one functional stereotype I don\'t want to see. Like many other Asian-American movies, there is a touch on the whole West vs East ideology debate with the mother-in-law, but the resolution was awful. The story just hits a wall as the heir just puts everything on halt and asks for girl\'s hand on the airplane. A good effort, but the kind that comes out of an American monocle long after aviators have taken over the world.',

The story is not particularly strong. However, the movie is saved by Phoenix\'s award-worthy performance and the felicitous soundtracks. The social commentary on the class struggle is particularly apt for the tumultuous year of 2019. You might need to watch this movie a couple of times to know which scene is real and which scene is Arthur Fleck\'s imagination.
